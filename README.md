# HarnessGUI
Python GUI built in Tkinter for operating the Harness

## Main Features
- Configuration settings loaded automatically
- Configuration settings can be changed by user
- Java Program for Harness is run from GUI itself
- Error checks for shell scripts on the Status Check window

## Running the Code
The Harness GUI is built using Python3 and tkinter. The user must have both installed. Then, from inside the HarnessGUI directory: 
**python3 main.py** will run the program

- Integrate GUI w/ Harness for testing
- Implement a more robust shell scripting in back-end
