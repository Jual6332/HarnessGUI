# HarnessGUI
Python GUI built in Tkinter for operating the Harness

## Prerequisits
The following are needed to run the Harness GUI software
- Python3 (3.3 or newer required, developed on 3.5.2)
- Tkinter library for GUI features

## Main Features
- Error checks for shell scripts on the Status Check window
- Java Program for Harness is run from GUI (via shell)
- Configuration settings editable for user
- Configuration settings loaded automatically

## Running the Code
Clone this repo. Then, from inside the HarnessGUI directory: 
**python3 main.py** will run the program

## What's Ahead
- Integrate GUI w/ Harness for testing
- Implement a more robust shell scripting in back-end
- Make changes to UI as need be, document code for others
